# rubbernecker

Pivotal is useful. But it's a weird layout so it is hard to use for day to day stuff. This is the start of a dashboard sort of thing to make something useful. For me anyway.

##Installation

Clone this repo

``` 
npm install
DEBUG=rubbernecker:* PIVOTAL_API_KEY=your-api-key PIVOTAL_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id npm start
```
